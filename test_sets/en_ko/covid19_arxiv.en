Social connectedness was negatively affected across most mental and neurological conditions.
This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients.
While the latter presumably operates during viral mRNA capping, ExoN is thought to mediate proofreading during genome replication.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected people all over the world.
Also, following the guidelines- hand-washing, avoiding public gathering, social distancing and covering nose and mouth has now become imperative.
With no specific therapeutic and prophylactic options available, the virus was able to infect millions of people.
Observed increased risks of COVID-19 related death among people with COPD and asthma receiving ICS can be plausibly explained by unmeasured confounding due to disease severity.
All IVIG lots produced neutralization of SARS-CoV ranging from 39.5 to 55.1 % and PRNT50 values ranging from 2.0 to 3.3.
Aim To determine clinical factors of a poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 infection.
An interesting finding is that of test per confirmed case which shows that every 6th person in Maharashtra and every 8th in Delhi is showing positive result of Covid-19 test.
However, despite their long-term use and only few case reports on adverse effects, CQ and HCQ are listed as a known risk of the lethal ventricular arrhythmia Torsade de Pointes and their cardiac safety profile is being questioned.
Remarkably, a low frequency of recurrent mutations was observed; only 182 mutations (5.67%) had a prevalence greater than 1%.
We found that the size of this population of ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ACE2-expression type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the Asian sample reported by Yu Zhao et al.
Abnormal rates of blood lymphocyte and PCT were significantly higher in Patients with elevated AngII level.
In light of supply chain failures for reagents and consumables needed for purification of nucleic acid for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR, we aim to verify the performance and utility of a non-extraction protocol for RT-PCR ("direct RT-PCR").
A cellular target is necessary to control for PCR inhibition and specimen quality.
The coronavirus surface features a trimeric spike (S) protein that is essential in viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion.
Single cell RNA-seq and immunostaining showed that the putative viral entry receptor ACE2 is expressed in multiple hESC-derived colonic cell types, but highly enriched in enterocytes.
